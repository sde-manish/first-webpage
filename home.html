        <p>Let's learn about <strong>SaaS</strong></p>
        <h1>What is SaaS?</h1>   <!-- <h1> to <h6> tags are used for different size of header -->   
        <p><u>Software as a service</u> (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internet—as a service. Instead of installing and
             maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.<br> <br>   <!-- <br> tag is used to break the paragraph and start in next line.if we use multiple <br> tags it will it will start in next line after leaving blank all the lines as many tags are used.  -->
            SaaS applications are sometimes called Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS
             applications run on a SaaS provider’s servers. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, 
             and performance.</p>
        <h1>SaaS Characteristics</h1>
        <p>A good way to understand the SaaS model is by thinking of a bank, which protects the privacy of each customer while providing
             service that is reliable and secure—on a massive scale. A bank’s customers all use the same financial systems and technology
              without worrying about anyone accessing their personal information without authorisation.

            A “bank” meets the key characteristics of the SaaS model:</p>
            <h3><b>Multitenant Architecture</b></h3>
            <p>A multitenant architecture, in which all users and applications share a single, common infrastructure and code base that 
                is centrally maintained. Because SaaS vendor clients are all on the same infrastructure and code base, vendors can
                 innovate more quickly and save the valuable development time previously spent on maintaining numerous versions of 
                 outdated code.</p>
            <h3><b>Easy Customisation</b></h3>
            <p>The ability for each user to easily customise applications to fit their business processes without affecting the 
                common infrastructure. Because of the way SaaS is architected, these customisations are unique to each company or
                 user and are always preserved through upgrades. That means<i> SaaS providers</i> can make upgrades more often, with less 
                 customer risk and much lower adoption cost.</p>
            <h3><b>Better Access</b></h3>
            <p>Improved access to data from any networked device while making it easier to manage privileges, monitor data use,
                 and ensure everyone sees the same information at the same time.</p>
            <h3><b>SaaS Harnesses the Consumer Web</b></h3>
            <p>Anyone familiar with Amazon.com or My Yahoo! will be familiar with the Web interface of typical SaaS applications. 
                With the SaaS model, you can customise with point-and-click ease, making the weeks or months it takes to update
                 traditional business software seem hopelessly old fashioned.</p>
            <h3><b>SaaS Trends</b></h3>
            <p>Organisations are now developing SaaS integration platforms (or SIPs) for building additional SaaS applications. 
                The consulting firm Saugatuck Technology calls this the “third wave” in software adoption: when SaaS moves beyond 
                standalone software functionality to become a platform for mission-critical applications.<br>SaaS is one of several
                 cloud computing solutions for business IT issues. Other ‘as-a-Service’ options include:</p>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – the provider hosts hardware, software, storage and other infrastructure component

                    </li>
                       <li> Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
                        <li>Everything as a service (XaaS) – which is essentially all the "aaS" tools neatly packaged together.</li>
                </ul>
            <h1>The benefits of SaaS</h1>
            <p>Increased efficiency and cost effectiveness are the reasons many businesses give for turning to cloud-based SaaS
                 solutions. The advantages include:<br>
                 <ol>
                     <li><strong>Low setup and infrastructure costs</strong><br>You just pay for what you need with no capital expenditure 
                        that needs to be depreciated on your balance sheet over time.</strong></li>
                        <li><b>Accessible from anywhere</b><br>Just connect to the internet and you can work from wherever you need to be
                             via <em>desktop, laptop, tablet or mobile </em>or other networked device.</li>
                        <li><b>Scalability</b><br>You can adapt your requirements to the number of people who need to use the system, 
                            the volume of data and the functionality required as your business grows.</li>
                        <li><b>Industry leading service level agreements (SLAS) for uptime and performance</b><br>So you have assurances 
                            that the software will be available to use when you need it – a difficult promise for in-house teams to make.</li>
                        <li><b>Automatic, frequent updates</b><br>Providers offer timely improvements thanks to their scale and because they
                             receive feedback about what their customers need. This frees up your IT department for other more business-
                             critical tasks.</li>
                        <li><b>Security at the highest level required by any customer</b><br>Because of the shared nature of the service,
                             all users benefit from the security level that’s been set up for those with the highest need.</li>
                 </ol>
                
                </p>
            <h1>The future of SaaS</h1>
            <p>
                Cloud computing and SaaS have come a long way in a short time. Increased awareness and uptake has accelerated the
                 growth of SaaS products and led to the rise of SaaS Integration Platforms (SIPs) such as Infrastructure as a Service 
                 (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). Companies will continue to outsource non-core IT activities to specialist 
                 service providers who can do it better. The cloud approach can help companies develop end-to-end integrated solutions 
                 and allow them to concentrate on what they do best, leaving a wide range of hardware and software IT issues to service
                  providers.<br><br>With companies adopting various "aaS" services, long-term relationships with service providers will
                   grow – which in turn will lead to innovation as customers' growing needs are understood and provided for.<br><br>In the
                    future, high-performance computing will help with a wide range of business uses, such as analysing large volumes of
                     customer data and monitoring application logs. SaaS may be one day be able to help address critical challenges for
                      business such as predicting which customers will churn or which cross-selling practices work best for your business.
                      <br><br>
                      With the need for high-volume data, software performance and backup increasingly daily, it’s easy to see why so many
                       businesses are choosing to outsource to cloud-based providers. If you’re considering a move to a SaaS platform, find 
                       out what Salesforce has to offer for businesses of all sizes.
